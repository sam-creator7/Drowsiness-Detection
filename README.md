# Drowsiness-Detection

This project is a Driver Drowsiness Detection System, aimed at preventing road accidents caused by drowsy driving. The system works by continuously monitoring the driver's eye movements and facial features and alerting them if they become drowsy while driving.

The system is implemented using Python programming language and OpenCV library, which is a computer vision library. The project description can be found at the following link: https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-driver-drowsiness-detection-system/. The article provides a detailed explanation of the steps involved in building the system, including the use of Haar cascades to detect the driver's face, the calculation of the aspect ratio of the eyes, and the use of dlib library to detect 68 facial landmarks.

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a useful tool for ensuring road safety. The system can be further improved and optimized by incorporating more advanced computer vision techniques and using larger datasets for training the model. Additionally, the system can be integrated with other safety features in vehicles to make driving even safer.
